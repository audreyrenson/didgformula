Description: This package implements the estimators described in the paper titled
            'The difference-in-differences g-formula', along with a small simulation 
            (also described in that paper) to illustrate the large-sample properties
            of the estimators. Currently, only nonparametric models for binary exposures,
            binary covariates, and continuous outcomes are implemented.
